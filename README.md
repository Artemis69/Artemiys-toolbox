# Artemiys Toolbox

When I needed to count the number of characters in a string, that's when I had the idea of making a toolbox, here it is

It works on [Solid JS](https://github.com/solidjs/solid) and [Vanilla Extract](https://github.com/seek-oss/vanilla-extract) (but does not use all of its features, as it was first written in linaria)

Fast bundling is ensured by [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite)

This site could have been written much, much better, but I'm lazy
